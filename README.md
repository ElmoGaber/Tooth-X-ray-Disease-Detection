The use of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in oral health has brought a paradigm shift in the detection and diagnosis of dental diseases, especially tooth x-ray analysis. This research paper aims to give an insight into the complex realm of advanced tooth X-ray disease detection through use of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence with emphasis on configuration matrices, loss equations, object detection techniques used in this state-of-the-art technology.

AI and deep learning, which have transformed healthcare and other fields of medicine, have also had a great impact on radiology. One major area where this technological breakthrough holds great potential is the recognition of dental diseases at their initial stages via assessment of dental X-ray images. By using recent advanced deep learning models in object detection and segmentation such as Faster R-CNN combined with these numbering techniques, medical professionals can greatly enhance accuracy and speed in diagnosis for a range of dental conditions especially those associated with inflammation
